GUPnP MediaServer
==================

GUPnP is an object-oriented open source framework for creating UPnP devices and
control points, written in C using GObject and libsoup. The GUPnP API is
intended to be easy to use, efficient and flexible.

GUPnP MediaServer is an implementation of the UPnP MediaServer V 2.0
specification[1] based on GUPnP and tracker[2]. It is written (mostly) in Vala
language[3].
